But I never thought that my company will help me to finally start (actually continue) blogging :smiley:.\n\nBlogging for 100 days, coming up with new topics will be hard, I plan to write a lot about **tech and design related topics**. The next few post will be about how I created this blog, what tech I use, and some interesting personal info. :wink:\nI will also join the [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/) challenge and create digest posts weekly with my designs.\n\nStay tuned. \n*balaki*","Title":"The 100 days blogging challenge","image":{"publicURL":"/static/cb0211446c0dccbddf2f50ec043fca9b/26c559d936e7dd02dbf5ee14aca2f9fa.svg"}}}]}}}
